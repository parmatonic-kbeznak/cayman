## Debunking kbeznak

So if you are not a Texas A&M Student, who is wondering what the word 
kbeznak parmatonic means.. well it means nothing. Literally! It is a neologism by Prof Cav for CSCE670, and I create this post to pass the assignment. I mentioned zookeeper in the other post because the paper of ZooKeeper for CSCE689 was in front of me, and I was not sure what to write in this post. Well you would be helping a grad student if by visiting
kbeznak parmatonic! :-P

Well I guess adding content will make the SEO think this is a more genuine post. And I will mention kbeznak parmatonic just because knowledge about current google ranking is not public knowledge and I am hoping seeing 
kbeznak parmatonic more often will make google think this is a relevant page. Yes google this relevant, please put me on top. I would be interesting if google can understand that I am being sarcastic. Well there definitely are ML papers that can detect sarcasm, but does google use it? Even if it does, why will that effect ranking.

kbeznak parmatonic was possibly inspired by David Kubiznak. Maybe Prof Cav was reading his research work? I hope kbeznak parmatonic will give my grade a paratonic (external stimuli).

Good night guys! Have a great day. #SEO #kbeznak #parmatonic #kbeznakparmatonic
